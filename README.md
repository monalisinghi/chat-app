# Getting Started with Chat app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all the dependencies.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Solution approach

Using Firebase for real-time communication and Firestore for storing chat messages provides a reliable and scalable solution. Leveraging Firebase Authentication allows users to sign in securely with their Google accounts, and the flexibility to extend it to other authentication methods like Facebook, Twitter, email/password, or mobile number sign-in is a valuable feature.

Application is responsive that ensures it can adapt to various screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience across different platforms. By using React, I have access to a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture facilitates code reuse and maintainability.

Additionally, using CSS and potentially extending it to SCSS with modular styling approaches helps in achieving a more organized and maintainable codebase. By leveraging variables, mixins, and other SCSS features, I can create reusable styles and promote a consistent design throughout the application.

## Future opportunities

- Modular Code with Component-Specific Styles and Common Utilities:
Breaking down code into smaller, modular components with component-specific styles can enhance reusability and make it easier to manage and maintain the codebase. By separating components and their associated styles, you create a more organized structure that promotes code reusability. Additionally, having a separate utils folder for common utility functions helps in centralizing and sharing common functionalities across the application.

- Replacing Cookies with Local/Session Storage:
Cookies have been a widely used method for storing small pieces of data on the client-side. However, alternatives like Local Storage and Session Storage offer more flexibility and security. Local Storage provides persistent storage that remains even when the browser is closed and reopened, while Session Storage offers storage that lasts only for the duration of the user's session. Both options provide a larger storage capacity compared to cookies and can be accessed easily using JavaScript.

- Adding Unit and Integration Tests:
Unit tests and integration tests play a crucial role in ensuring the correctness of code. Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation, verifying that they behave as expected. Integration tests, on the other hand, test the interaction between multiple components to ensure they work together correctly. By incorporating tests into your development process, you can catch bugs and regressions early, increase code reliability, and facilitate easier code maintenance and refactoring.

Overall, these suggestions aim to improve code organization, enhance data storage techniques, and promote code quality through testing. Implementing these practices can lead to more maintainable, scalable, and robust software applications.
